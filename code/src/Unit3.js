            <p className='Title'>Toponym Anaylsis By Aniela Sielaff</p>
            <p>Some of the names come from being named after other people, such as Colon and David.
                These are both named after European key figures, Christopher Columbus and King David from the Bible. 
                These names could therefore represent colonialism of Panama. 
                A couple of the other names are named after the native tribes that used to live there, showing an amount of respect for the land that was taken from these tribes. 
                This represents how despite how the land was taken, people still hold onto roots in this place. 
                One of these names translates to "Nome [an important chief] was punished." 
                This is a way that the local people were able to honor people who were lost to conquistadors. 
                A decent amount of the names are named as words in Spanish, such as "La Chorerra", "Aguadulce", "La Pintada", and "Las Tablas". 
                Many of these names refer to something about the landscape or the founding of the city. 
                Additionally, through these names we can see who was valued as important and significant enough to have a city named after them, such as Colonel Armuellas.

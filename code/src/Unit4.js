                Overall South Korea is a stable state. Its government is fairly similar to the United States. Gerrymandering is present but is a problem being worked on. The biggest problem is the border with North Korea. North and South Korea have been in conflict in the past. If there's a threat to South Korea, it's most likely going to be from North Korea.

            <p className="Title Smaller">Analysis</p>
            <p className="Unit5Analysis">Agriculture in South Korea is mostly based on Rice and Soybeans. There is not much variety and based on the government's actions and policies, this seems to be a small problem. The South Korean economy of electronics and machines is much more interesting, being what most of what South Korea exports are. Companies like Samsung, LG, and Hyundai contribute to these exports. South Korea is much more focused on their electronic economy than their agricultural economy. </p>

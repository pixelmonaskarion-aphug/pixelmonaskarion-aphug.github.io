changes to today's economy
	With the creation of guilds, the Song Dynasty greatly improved its economy. Before the Song Dynasty, the government stopped merchants from acting as sellers of goods that the government sold themselves. After they became open to merchants selling their goods, the economy of the Song Dynasty became worth talking about today.
	The government today is more leanient about unions, they let some exist, but they deny the right to unionize to some groups. It doesn't help that management of companies also try to prevent unions from starting.
	Taking what we learned from the Song Dynasty we could improve today's economy by making unions more widespread, Having the government regulate rules about how managers can stop unions, and most importantly, encouraging people to join unions for their workplaces.
